I have created a simple application in C that lets you control your GNU/Linux computer through SMS from your cell phone. The app is not feature rich (yet), but works and I will surely add more features users request. For the time being, all you need to do is send an simple SMS from your cell phone to a SMS gateway and the program grabs the commands you send and executes it your remote PC. Short description and usage

Using it, you can do some crucial tasks like -
* forgot a file at home? Just one sms will attach and e-mail it to you
* application you are waiting for got released. Send it via SMS, it will get downloaded so that you can use it when you are back home..

Some similar applications are there, but their capability is limited to shutting down/locking screen/downloading things. But with the help of this you can execute ANY valid Linux command line tasks...

Some TODO which I would like to add:
* executing commands by a Tweet
* something which grabs a screenshot and mails it to user

I am a new programmer, so I want others to improve the code, obviously this thing will be open source under no restrictions

And free too, you dont need to pay to control YOUR computer..
